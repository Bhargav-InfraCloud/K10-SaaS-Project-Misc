// - Console calls StartLogsCollection to request logs archive from agent(s).
// - 3 types of logs to request/fetch -
//      1. CPP agent logs
//          - These may be saved in file(s) locally on the CPP agent container or in a PV to easily read and write.
//      2. Go agent logs
//          - Similar to CPP, these logs can be stored locally in file(s) on the Go agent container or in a PV.
//          - If PV, it should be accessible by CPP agentâ€™s container for sharing the logs.
//          - If stored in a file, local to container, a gRPC call between agents is required.
//          TODO: Select an approach
//      3. K10 service logs
//          - Archive from K10 service can be downloaded using API calls:
//              $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/k10/dashboardbff-svc/v0/supportLogs/
//              $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/k10/dashboardbff-svc/v0/supportLogs/<id-from-previous-call> --output k10logs.zip
// - No proto is required for this call. VCF method will take the following as arguments -
//      1. Start time
//      2. End time
//      3. Type of logs required (above discussed 3 types or their combination)
// - The result will be another VCF call SendLogStream from agent to console.
// - Return value is bool confirming whether SendLogStream was successful.
