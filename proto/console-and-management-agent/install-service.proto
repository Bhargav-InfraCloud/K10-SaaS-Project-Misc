// K8s distribution details aren't required here. 
// The agent sends the K8s distribution details to console while registering.
// And while forwarding this request over gRPC between agents, the agent has to add the distribution details.

// Every distribution except for OnPremise will have a list of permissions, etc. as prerequisite.
// Need to discuss if we start with this from start or work with on-premise first and extend later on.

// Also, cloud providers like AWS has multiple types of installations and integrations.
